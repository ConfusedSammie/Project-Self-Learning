## Constraints
-   Arrays may not be used to contain the binary digits entered by the user
-   Determining the decimal equivalent of a particular binary digit in the sequence must be calculated using a single mathematical function, for example the natural logarithm. It's up to you to figure out which function to use.

## User Stories

-   [Bonus] User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field
-   [x] User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered
-   [x] User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered

## Bonus features

-   [x] User can enter a variable number of binary digits
