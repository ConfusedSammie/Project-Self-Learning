My attempt at creating fun games to put in 404 pages.

Things to learn for optimization:
1. [x] requestAnimationFrame in JS
2. [x] Use Transform instead of Top-Bottom-etc. for smoother transitions.
3. [x] Only check for collision once and add a game-over text and stop the game.
4. [x] Replace boxes with SVG and PNG images.
5. [x] Make game look better.
6. [ ] Make it so the red box appears at randomly generated times
7. [ ] Allow the character to duck with the down arrow.
8. [ ] Once 7 is done, allow the red box to appear at randomly generated distance_y
9. [ ] Allow the red box to appear in either .. or :
