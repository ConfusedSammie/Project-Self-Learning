# Self-Taught Mini-Projects 
## Introduction
The basis of this repository is to showcase and practice different coding practices and mini-projects as a personal project. The goal of this repository is to be able to easily re-use functionalities and code in the future with an easy plug-and-play functionality.
## Project List
This list is coming-soon once I have more projects developed. :)
